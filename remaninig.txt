7. When the user has an active subscription (ie; user_Subscription_End Data is greater than today) and if the user subnscripbed to a plan again the user_Subscription_EndDate has to be updated from the current End Date, eg: has an active subscription till Jan 22 , subscribed for a 2 month plan again, the user subscription gets updated withe the 2 month subscription and the subscription End Date will get updated to March 22 not feb 22
8. But if the user is subscripbed for an Organization Subscription the end Date will be the endDate for the Coupon Created for the organisation.
10. User_Subscription End Date should be saved physically (do not calculate on calling /get-profile api) so that even if the subscritopn duration get changed it wont affect the already subsxcribed users.

11. When the organization logs in and chooses an organization subscription Plans
They call "subscription-service/api/v1/payment/Order" and then call a different api
which creates a coupon for how many subscriptions they need say for eg: 50 and sent it to the Email Id of the organization.
12. Save the Request with paid price , quantity ,actual price etc.. in DB
